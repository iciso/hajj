          "O Allah, this is Your House and I am Your servant, son of Your servant, son of Your maidservant. You have carried me on what You have made subservient to me from Your creation, and You have made me journey through Your lands until You brought me, by Your favor, to Your House, and You have helped me perform my rites. If You are pleased with me, then increase Your pleasure with me; otherwise, be pleased with me now before I depart from Your House. Now is the time of my departure, if You permit me, without substituting anyone for You or for Your House, and without turning away from You or from Your House. O Allah, grant me well-being in my body, protection in my faith, bless my return, and grant me obedience to You as long as You keep me alive. Combine for me the good of this world and the Hereafter, for You have power over all things.",
